    "### Description\n",
    "This function processes `.txt` files in a specified directory to extract relevant information and write it to different output files based on their content. It categorizes the files into three categories:\n",
    "1. **Files with valid questions and answers**: Written to `web_data.txt`.\n",
    "2. **Files that could not be processed**: Written to `filtered.txt`.\n",
    "3. **Files with questions containing `?` but not ending with `?`**: Written to `inspecting.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "- **`directory_path`**: Path to the directory containing `.txt` files.\n",
    "- **`web_data_file`**: Path to the output file for valid questions and answers.\n",
    "- **`filtered_file`**: Path to the output file for files that couldn't be processed.\n",
    "- **`inspecting_file`**: Path to the output file for questions containing `?` but not ending with `?`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "- **`web_data.txt`**: Contains the valid question and answer data.\n",
    "- **`filtered.txt`**: Contains filenames of files that couldn't be processed.\n",
    "- **`inspecting.txt`**: Contains questions with `?` but not ending with `?` along with their details.\n"
