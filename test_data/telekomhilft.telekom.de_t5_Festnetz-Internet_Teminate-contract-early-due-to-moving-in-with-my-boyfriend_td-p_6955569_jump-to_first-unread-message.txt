Accepted Solutions:
- @cilouThank you for the conversation earlier.It's a pity that we couldn't come to an agreement. As your current contract can be moved 1:1 to the new address and your friend's contract is with a different provider, there is unfortunately no special right of termination.The only option is for you to move the contract to the new address or to cancel the connection at the end of the contract term. Unfortunately, we have no other option.Best regardsTimur
