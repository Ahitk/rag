Subject: Speedport Smart 4 Plus: DHCPv4 not working causing internet outages
Content: Since morning, DHCPv4 server does not seem to be working anymore on the Speedport device. I can see "(DH001)DHCPv6 is active" messages in the system logs. The last "(H001) DHCP is active" message was seen over 24 hours ago.I have tried the following:Restart the Speedport router multiple times.Deactivate and reactivate DHCP viahttps://speedport.ip/html/content/network/dhcp.html(with and without restarts).Tried usinghttps://www.telekom.de/hilfe/hilfe-bei-stoerungenbut it says it cannot perform the diagnostics.The wireless mesh seems to be flakey as well. It seems that the nodes are not receiving IPv4 addresses (as expected when DHCPv4 is not working) and then trying to reconnect.Other relevant notes.Firmware version is010142.3.9.001.0.WAN is fiber optic.There are several static address allocations tied to MAC addresses on the LAN.There are no switches or routers upstream to the router.There is one PoE switch downstream to the router.The only way I can connect over WiFi right now with a v4 address is using a static IPv4 config.As a last resort I am going to reset the router, hopefully that someone who fixes the issue. If anyone has ideas around what to do here or know of any similar issues reported before, much appreciated.

- Hallo@nulltermination,I would try the following:- deactivate WLAN- power off the Speedport router- disconnect all LAN cables- wait for 15 minutes- power on the router, WLAN off- connect a single PC/Laptop with LAN cableIf this does not work I would try a factory reset of the router.Best wishes,Coole Katze
