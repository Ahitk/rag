Subject: How do I get credit for a closed posting account?
Content: Dear Telekom Customer Service,I am writing to inquire about a credit on my April invoice dated March 22, related to posting account number xxxxxx0582. The invoice stated that I would receive a â‚¬3.81 credit on the next invoice. However, this account was only used for my router rental contract, which was canceled on March 14, so there won't be any further invoices for this account. My current landline and router contract is under posting account number xxxxxx2716.Could you please advise how I can receive this credit now that the account has been closed?Thank you for your assistance.
