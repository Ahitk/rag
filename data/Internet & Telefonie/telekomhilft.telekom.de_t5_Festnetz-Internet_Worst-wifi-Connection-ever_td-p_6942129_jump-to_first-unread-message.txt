Subject: Worst wifi Connection ever
Content: I recently ordered WLAN for my house on 08/28/24. And I got a technician appointment on 09/06/24. I am working from home IT professional so I hope you understand how important for me to have wifi at home. So the technician came on09/06/24at some 2:30 pm and he checked for a long time and said he couldn't find anything and he cannot do anything so I have to book one more technician appointment. So now the next technician came on09/10/24(already 2 weeks without any connection) and gave me the connection and the wifi was working fine until09/17/24, 1:30 pm, and suddenly it went off. Then I contacted the customer care they said there might be problem with router, which I got just a week back and I was sent a new router and cable. The new router again took some 2days to get delivered and it came today. But no use at all nothing is working. This is so irritating and worst experience ever. Believe me this is all in Cologne a Metropolis. I just want to terminate the contract immediately because I cannot trust these and wait some longer. Never going to make a mistake of choosing Telekom again. I hope you can get over my frustration that led me to write this post. Thank you
