Subject: Cancel contracts
Content: Hello,I have three contacts in Telekom.One is for internet and landline connection, another is for magenta tv and the third one is for mobile phone. I would like to keep for a few months more the mobile phone contract only to take care some procedural stuff that may require an SMS for 2-FA or people from other services who are trying to contact me etc...The other two I would like to cancel them, because I am leaving Germany.I have the paper of deregistration from the city hall.Thank you!
